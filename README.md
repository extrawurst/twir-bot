# twir-bot
Little discord ðŸ¤– helping [TWIR](https://github.com/rust-lang/this-week-in-rust) ðŸ¦€ authors managing weekly community updates.

# context
The weekly updates from the community is assembled by a couple of contributors gathering links in a discord channel first for review and later assembly into a PR. Assembling the PR usually meant a lot of manual effort. This bot simplifies this a lot:
